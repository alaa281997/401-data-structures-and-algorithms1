# Singly Linked List
Linked List is a linear data structure.linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers

## Challenge
Create a method called insert to takes a value to add it to the end of a linked list.
Creat a method called search to search if the elements of linked list are exits or not.
create a method called toString to print the linked list as string

## Approach & Efficiency
I used O(1) (last-in-first-out) the last node in list will be before last.
